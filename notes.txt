Linker definition:
A linker is a software tool that combines multiple object files generated by a compiler into a single executable file, library, or another object file. It resolves references between these object files, such as function calls and variable accesses, by assigning final memory addresses to each symbol. The linker also handles tasks such as symbol resolution, address relocation, and the inclusion of necessary libraries. Linkers can operate in two modes: static linking, where all code is combined into one executable at compile time, and dynamic linking, where external libraries are linked at runtime.

Operators in C++:
1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
2. Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
3. Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
4. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
5. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator: ? :
7. Comma Operator: ,
8. sizeof Operator: sizeof()
